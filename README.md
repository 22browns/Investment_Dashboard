# Investment_Dashboard
Hello, this repository includes a personal project of mine and **as of July 7th, 2024 this project is still in progress**.
This project is meant to serve two functions: 1) Providing a one stop shop to analyze company financial performance over time (the accounting page serves as an example of how I plan on accomplishing this), 2) tracking the performance and accuracy of my ULTA stock pitch using a variety of benchmarks

USAGE:
To use this page you can copy and paste the provided files (index, accounting, and stock.html) into your own IDE or Text Editor (I used VS Code) and then open the Index.html file in default browser.

DISCLAIMER: This accounting and stock information pages were set up using Alpha Vantage and its demo API calls, therefore the only stock ticker that can provide full capabilities of these two pages is IBM.
